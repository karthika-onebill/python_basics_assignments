1) Create a decorator to print a statement n no. of times.
	n is the number of times you want to print a statement
			   Example INPUT/OUTPUT 1
					What do you want to print?
					>> Hello World
					How many times do you want to print the statement?
					>> 5
					#OUTPUT
							Hello World
							Hello World
							Hello World
							Hello World
							Hello World
							
				Example INPUT/OUTPUT 2
						What do you want to print?
						>> Stranger Things
						How many times do you want to print the statement?
						>> 0
						#OUTPUT
						
				Example INPUT/OUTPUT 3
						What do you want to print?
						>> Stranger Things
						How many times do you want to print the statement?
						>> -1
						#OUTPUT
						Please provide a positive number
				Example INPUT/OUTPUT 4
						What do you want to print?
						>> Stranger Things
						How many times do you want to print the statement?
						>> 3
						# OUTPUT
						Stranger Things
						Stranger Things
						Stranger Things

2) Define a class named Circle which can be constructed by a radius. 
  Compare two circles objects and return True if circles are equal. 
  Return False if circles are not equal
  Take radius of these circles through Input
(Write the code in operator_overloading concept)
			Expected Input/Output 1:
				Enter Radius of Circle 1: 2
				Enter Radius of circle 2: 4
				Output: False
				
			Expected Input/Output 2:
				Enter Radius of Circle 1: 8
				Enter Radius of circle 2: 8
				Output: True
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and width.
 The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area.
		Expected Input/Output 1:
				Enter length of rectangle: 2
				Enter breadth of rectangle: 2
				Area of rectangle: 4
		
		Expected Input/Output 2:
			Enter length of rectangle: 1
			Enter breadth of rectangle: 1
			Area of rectangle: 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)Define a class named Circle which can be constructed by a radius. 
The Circle class has 4 methods which can
	1.compute the circumference and
	2.area of both circle
	3.able to add two circles
	4.Compare two circles and find which is bigger
	5.Check if the circles are equal
	
Expected Input/Output 1:
	Enter radius of Circle 1: 2
	Enter radius of Circle 2: 4
	Circumference if circle 1: 12.56
	Circumference if circle 2: 25.12
	Area of circle 1: 12.56
	Area of circle 2: 50.24
	Circle 2 is bigger than Circle 1
	
Expected Input/Output 2:
	Enter radius of Circle 1: 4
	Enter radius of Circle 2: 4
	Circumference if circle 1: 25.12
	Circumference if circle 2: 25.12
	Area of circle 1: 50.24
	Area of circle 2: 50.24
	Both Circle are Equal
